# HeartDiseasePrediction
This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on patient health attributes such as age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, and more.

Using a dataset of 918 patients with 16 features, I performed:

Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Seaborn & Matplotlib for medical insights.

One-hot encoding for categorical variables.

Handling class imbalance with SMOTE & Random Oversampling.

Modeling using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Cross-validation (StratifiedKFold) for robust evaluation.

The goal is not only prediction accuracy but also interpretability and recall (catching as many positive cases of heart disease as possible).
